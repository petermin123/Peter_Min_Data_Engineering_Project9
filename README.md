# Mini_Project_9
[![CI/CD Pipeline](https://github.com/petermin123/Peter_Min_Data_Engineering_Project9/actions/workflows/cicd.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/petermin123/Peter_Min_Data_Engineering_Project9/actions/workflows/cicd.yml)

This is the README for my Mini Project 9 for the IDS706 - Data Engineering Systems class at Duke University.

## Overview
The idea is to harness the power of cloud computing to carry out data analytics and visualizations tasks for us. For this project, I migrated everything I had for Mini_Project_2 to a Google Colab notebook and saved a copy of itself to GitHub.

## Dataset
The dataset comes from Kaggle, a public machine learning and data science community. It contains a CSV file of detailed information regarding the most-streamed Spotify songs in 2023. Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/top-spotify-songs-2023/data

## Data Visualization
For the visualization, I analyzed and visualized the 10 hottest artists by their stream counts.

## Summary Statistics
Here is a glimpse into the summary statistics for certain columns from the dataset by running `dataframe.describe()`:
